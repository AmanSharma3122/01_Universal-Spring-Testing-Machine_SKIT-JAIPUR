#### 1. Focus Area : 

Any elastic member which can deform under a force can act as a spring. The main function of a spring is to a deflect under a load and to recover the original shape when the load is released. Helical compression spring may be expanded to twice its length without losing its elasticity. Basically need to focus about how spring material behaves by applying absorb shock or impact loading as like in to store energy as in clock springs, to apply forces to and to control motions as in brakes and clutches and to measure forces as in spring balances.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 When the user opens the experiment, he/she reads and understands the theory, after that he/she see the procedure through which he have to perform the experiment.
In the simulator part he/she performs the experiment and analyzes the result obtained.
There are pre and post assignment quizzes which tests the knowledge of the student.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Know the use of vernier <br> caliper. | Measure outer diameter of the <br> spring. | Which instrument is used to measure the diameter of the  spring ?
2.| Know the use of vernier <br> caliper. | Measure the internal diameter of the <br> spring. | What would be the mean effective diameter and the diameter of the spring wire ?
3.| Know the position of the <br> spring. | Fix the spring on the machine. <br>  | Where we would fix the tensile spring on the machine ?
4.| Use of pressure valve and <br> caliper. | Close the pressure valve| Why we close the pressure valve?
5.| Effect of applying load on the<br> spring. |Apply the load on the spring | What is effect of applying load on the spring?
6.| Analyze the formulas and<br> calculations involved. |Observe the calculations involved <br>and analyze the result.| What are the formulas used in the calculations? <br>What can you conclude from the experiment?

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Select the experiment and click |Move the Vernier caliper to the<br> spring and measure the outer and <br>inner diameter of the spring.| To measure the inner and outer <br> diameter of the spring.
2.| Click on the spring to fix it on <br> the spring | Move the spring and fix it to the <br> machine and ready for the <br> experiment  | To fix the spring on the machine for testing.
3.| Click on the rotating valve to <br> close the pressure valve.| Rotate the wheel to show that the<br>valve is closing. |To close the pressure valve inside<br>the machine because the machine <br>is based on the hydraulic system. .
4.| Push the up button to set <br>the load. | It lifts the bars and compress the<br>spring according to the experiment <br>chosen and also rotates the dial to <br> show the applied load.  |To set the load and perform the <br> experiment.
